## Volunteers

Luscinia values our volunteers greatly. Due to funding restrictions of our nonprofit model we can only hire when positions are subsidized. This means that we depend on our entire permanent operation to be volunteer run. We actively encourage prospective volunteers to contribute on GitHub at [https://github.com/luscinia-enterprises](https://github.com/luscinia-enterprises) For our curriculum development and other teams, please contact [hiring@luscinia.ca](mailto:hiring@luscinia.ca).
